## 📝 Key Takeaways
- Machine Learning allows computers to *learn patterns from data* instead of explicit programming.  
- *Supervised learning* uses labeled training data to make predictions.  
- *Linear Regression* is a simple yet powerful method for prediction tasks.  
- *Cost Function (MSE)* measures how well our model fits the data.  
- *Gradient Descent* is used to minimize cost and optimize model parameters.
